      <h2>Games being leaked!</h2>
      <p class="p1">How crazy is it to think that after all the work these companies put into these games for us to enjoy that people who just cannot wait have to go and ruin it for everyone. This is not just GTA that this happens to either, almost every time that the Sims 4 announces that they have some type of big announcement up and coming, there is almost always somebody who leaks what the new pack or expansion is going to be. As someone who is going into game design myself, I find it very discouraging to know that there are people out there like that. If I put time and effort into something that people are excited about, I would want to be the person who announces it! That is like having extremely good news to share with your family and your little sibling telling everyone before you can.</p>
      <p class="p2"> I feel like there should be some legality around leaks in games because it is so compromising for the company and could hinder sales results. A Lot of people may feel that the legal aspect of it is not concerning and the company should do a better job at protecting its information, but why are we taking the blame away from the perpetrator? This ultimately is the same as stealing content in my eyes. People are now talking about this leak instead of the new content or game that is being released. How do you feel about people leaking games and content? Do you feel that it is not a big deal? </p>
